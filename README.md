# IT_LAB_PROJECT

This project is an Information Technology Lab Mini Project that involves building a web application using Flask, a Python web framework. The project includes three pages: a Home page, a Sign-in page, and a Dashboard page. The Home page displays basic information about the application and provides links to the Sign-in and Register pages. The Sign-in page allows users to sign in to the application using their username and password, which are stored in an Excel file. The Register page allows new users to create an account by providing their desired username and password.

Once signed in, users are redirected to the Dashboard page, where they can select a course and upload their resume. The course and resume details are stored in an Excel file, which can be viewed and styled using the style_excel_file() function. The application also includes error handling to ensure that users enter valid information.

The project requirements include Flask, Pandas, openpyxl, and Werkzeug modules. The application is built using Python programming language and HTML/CSS for frontend. The backend is implemented using Flask and Pandas for data handling. The project also includes user authentication and data storage in an Excel file.

The project execution process involves setting up a Flask application and implementing the three web pages. The backend database is an Excel file, and the data is handled using the Pandas module. The openpyxl module is used for styling the Excel file. The project working involves starting the Flask application and navigating to the Home page, where users can register or sign in. Once signed in, users are redirected to the Dashboard page, where they can select a course and upload their resume. The data is stored in the backend database, and users can view it by styling the Excel file.

Overall, the project involves building a simple web application that allows users to sign in, register, and upload their resumes. The project also includes backend data handling using Pandas and an Excel file, as well as styling of the Excel file using openpyxl.
